        <h1>Hello, I'm Lilly Parham</h1>
        <p>
          Driven by a deep passion for data and its power to shape strategic decisions, I am currently pursuing a dual Master’s degree in Business Administration (MBA) and Analytics (MSA) at Georgia State University. My academic journey is rooted in a strong foundation in quantitative analysis, data science, and business strategy, empowering me to bridge the gap between technical expertise and business impact.
          Throughout my professional experience—as a Graduate Research Assistant with the Southeast Regional Cooperative and through hands-on projects in data engineering, dashboard development, and AI-powered applications—I’ve leveraged tools like Python, SQL, Power BI, and machine learning to uncover trends, optimize operations, and support decision-making. Whether it’s streamlining supply chain logistics, analyzing consumer behavior, or deploying predictive models, I focus on transforming complex data into actionable business insights.
          My work is guided by the belief that data isn't just about numbers—it's about creating smarter, more agile organizations that thrive in a rapidly evolving digital world.
